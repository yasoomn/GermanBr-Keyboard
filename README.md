A german-Portuguese hybrid keyboard layout
I'm a Brazilian who lives in Germany and recently bought a laptop here. I soon realized how bad the german Keyboard layout is for typing in portuguese, so I decided to create a custom layout that adresses the following problems:
* The german layout has the Tilda (~) simbol if you press AltGr and +, but it is not a dead key, making it impossible to type words with ã or õ. This custom layout sets this key to a dead key, just like in the brazilian layout.
* There is no Cedilla (ç). The custom layout has it with the combination AltGr + c.
