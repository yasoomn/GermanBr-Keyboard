A german-Portuguese hybrid keyboard layout \n
I'm a Brazilian who lives in Germany and recently bought a laptop here. I soon realized how bad the german Keyboard layout is for typing in portuguese, so I decided to create a custom layout that adresses the following problems:
* The german layout has the Tilda (~) simbol if you press AltGr and +, but it is not a dead key, making it impossible to type words with ã or õ. This custom layout sets this key to a dead key, just like in the brazilian layout.
* There is no Cedilla (ç). The custom layout has it with the combination AltGr + c.

If you type AltGr and + two times it it outputs just the tilda like that: ~.
As a bonus I also added the possibility of typing ñ the same way you woul type ã.

After the instalation you have to add the custom layout in the Settings menu in "Time & Language" and in the "Devices" -> "Typing" -> "Advanced keyboard settings" menu.
